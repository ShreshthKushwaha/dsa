##suppose there are 1 to n bulbs and there is a bulb k
#it would be toggled the number of times the multiples
#eg : 16
#it can be toggled, 1,2,4,8,16 times 
#15..it can be toggled 1,3,5,15
#2..it can be toggled 1,2 
# in all the number of multiple times it can be toggled
#if number of multiples are odd then they will be left on
#logically only perfect squares have odd numbers of multiples
#in all the number of perfect squares within a range is the answer
#which is int(n**0.5)
